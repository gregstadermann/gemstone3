The Symbol of Need begins to burn in your mind and an image appears before you of Hammerrhead...

[Ghorsa Isle, Tower]
The view from the tower is spectacular. The city is spread out before you, huddled in a valley beneath the great mountain Stormbrow.

You also see a wooden charity bin, a marble ledge with some stuff on it and some marble stairs.

The street widens into a circular plaza several hundred feet across. Dwarves and giantmen lounge on stone benches by a massive granite fountain in the center.

You also see a white cat, a moldy raisin cupcake, a massive pyrothag, a yellow sapphire, a red granite statue and a wooden table with some stuff on it.
