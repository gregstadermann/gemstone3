- You are a senior developer.  
- We need to avoid duplication and build systems rather than editing lots of files.  
- Do not start the gemstone server youself.  I am using npm run dev to pickup file changes and automatically restart.  
- Do not restart the server manuallyâ€” we are using `npm run dev` which does this automatically.  
- For Docker development: Use `docker compose up -d` to start, `docker compose logs -f gemstone` to monitor, `docker compose down` to stop.
- Do not restart Docker containers manually - nodemon handles auto-restart on file changes.
- When suggesting Docker commands, always run from the `docker-dev/` directory.
- Volume mounting syncs changes instantly - no need to rebuild containers for code changes.  
- The containerized version of the app combines both gemstone3 and gemstone3-core.  Remember to search both in your analysis.
