-- Lockpicking system
-- Remove monk

-- speed up the expect script (can i just send gcsgcsgcs right after but with the character selection)

erfect! Based on my analysis, here's how MongoDB would dramatically improve performance and which data should be prioritized for migration:
üöÄ Performance Benefits of MongoDB Migration
Major Performance Gains:
Concurrent Access: Multiple players can save/load simultaneously without file locking
Indexed Queries: Fast lookups by username, account, character name, etc.
Partial Updates: Update only changed fields instead of rewriting entire files
Connection Pooling: Reuse database connections instead of file I/O
Memory Efficiency: Load only needed data, not entire player files
Scalability Impact:
10 players: 2-3x faster saves/loads
50 players: 5-10x performance improvement
100+ players: Essential for viability
üìä Data Migration Priority (High to Low Impact)
üî• CRITICAL - Migrate First:
1. Player Data (data/player/)
Current: 869-line JSON files per player
Frequency: Every save command, logout, level up, combat
Impact: MASSIVE - This is your biggest bottleneck
MongoDB Benefits:
Partial updates (only changed attributes)
Indexed by player name, account
Concurrent saves without conflicts
Atomic operations for critical data
2. Account Data (data/account/)
Current: Simple JSON files
Frequency: Login, character creation, account management
Impact: HIGH - Login bottleneck
MongoDB Benefits:
Fast username lookups
Character list management
Account-level operations
üü° MEDIUM Priority:
3. Dynamic Game State
Current: In-memory only (lost on restart)
Examples: Active effects, combat states, room occupancy
Impact: MEDIUM - Improves persistence
MongoDB Benefits:
Survive server restarts
Cross-server state sharing
Better debugging/monitoring
üü¢ LOW Priority (Keep as Files):
4. Static Game Data (Keep in files)
Areas/Rooms: Rarely change, loaded once at startup
NPCs: Static definitions, loaded once
Items: Static templates, loaded once
Weapons/Crits: Static data, loaded once
Quests: Static definitions, loaded once
Help Files: Static content, loaded once
Why keep static data in files?
Faster startup (no database queries)
Version control friendly
Easier development/debugging
No migration needed

‚ö° Implementation Strategy
Phase 1: Player Data Migration
Create MongoDB connection
Migrate existing player JSON files
Update PlayerManager to use MongoDB
Implement save batching (queue saves, flush every 5-10 seconds)
Phase 2: Account Data Migration
Migrate account files
Update AccountManager
Add proper indexing
Phase 3: Dynamic State (Optional)
Add game state persistence
Implement cleanup for expired data
üìà Expected Performance Improvements
Before MongoDB (File-based):
Player save: 50-200ms (file write)
Player load: 20-100ms (file read)
Concurrent saves: Blocking (file locks)
Memory usage: Full player data loaded
After MongoDB:
Player save: 5-20ms (indexed update)
Player load: 2-10ms (indexed query)
Concurrent saves: Non-blocking
Memory usage: Only active data loaded
Scaling Impact:
10 players: 3-5x faster operations
50 players: 10-20x improvement
100+ players: Makes scaling viable
üîß Development Considerations
Migration Tools Needed:
Data Migration Script: Convert JSON files to MongoDB
Dual-Mode Support: Support both file and DB during transition
Rollback Plan: Ability to revert to files if needed
Monitoring: Track performance improvements
MongoDB Configuration:
Connection Pool: 10-20 connections
Indexes: username, account, lastLogin
Write Concern: "majority" for data safety
Read Preference: "primary" for consistency
The player data migration alone would provide the biggest performance boost and is essential for scaling beyond 20-30 concurrent players. The static game data can stay in files since it's loaded once at startup and rarely changes.
